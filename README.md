# Finite volume method for shallow water equations

A 2D unstructured finite volume method (FVM) shallow water solver written in C++. Fluxes can be evaluated with the Laxâ€“Friedrichs or the Roe method. Implicit and explicit time stepping is available. Expicit time stepping can be performed with the Euler, the Runge-Kutta 2nd-order, and the Runge-Kutta 4th-order methods. The jacobian used for the implicit time stepping is numerically evaluated and the linear system of equations is solved with the BiCGSTAB method. The Eigen C++ template library for linear algebra is used along with OpenMP.

# Compile

The code requires the Eigen C++ template libary. Download the libary and extract its contents to a folder named Eigen inside the includes folder (includes/Eigen). Once extracted use make to compile the code. The sw_solver binary will be created in the bin folder. 

# Run

To run the code navigate to the folder of the case e.g. dam_coarse_lf and run ../bin/sw_solver dam. The program will solve the dam break problem using the Lax-Friedrichs method for 1000 time steps with a time step of 0.003. The full list of options is:

* dt - timestep
* N_timesteps - number of timesteps
* riemann_solver - Riemman solver; 1 - Lax-Friedrichs, 2 - Roe
* output_frequency - Results output frequency; 0 - no output, i where i > 0 - every ith iteration 
* integrator - Integration method; 0 - Euler, 1 - Runge-Kutta 2nd-order, 2 - Runge-Kutta 4th order
* implicit - Solve the equation explicitly or implicitly; 0 - Explicit, 1 - Implicit 

Note: If the implicit option is set to 1 the integrator option is not used.
